# Algorithms for finding prime numbers in Rust
As part of the Networking subject at NTNU: IDATT2104, I have created several different methods for finding prime
numbers up to a number N, or in a range from a to b. The primary goal of this task was to learn about concurrency
and threading.

I've had fun trying to slightly optimize some of these algorithms (althought they can be even more optimized!).
