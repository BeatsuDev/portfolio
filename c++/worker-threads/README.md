# CppWorkerThreads
This project is part of the Network programming course IDATT2104 at NTNU for the spring semester of 2023. The task was to create a Worker class with the given functionality:

```cpp
Workers worker_threads(4);
Workers event_loop(1);

worker_threads.start(); // Create 4 internal threads
event_loop.start(); // Create 1 internal thread

worker_threads.post([] {
    // Task A
});

worker_threads.post([] {
    // Task B
    // Might run in parallel with task A
});

event_loop.post([] {
    // Task C
    // Might run in parallel with task A and B
});

event_loop.post([] {
    // Task D
    // Will run after task C
    // Might run in parallel with task A and B
});

worker_threads.join(); // Calls join() on the worker threads
event_loop.join(); // Calls join() on the event thread
```

This task is the second task in the course (Ã˜ving 2).
