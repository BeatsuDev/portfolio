# CppPrimeNumbers
This project is part of the Network programming course IDATT2104 at NTNU for the spring semester of 2023.
The task was to create a prime counter (a program that counts the number of primes within a range) using threads.

This task is the first task in the course (Ã˜ving 1).

Compile the algorithms with the -Ofast flag for the fastest optimizations.
