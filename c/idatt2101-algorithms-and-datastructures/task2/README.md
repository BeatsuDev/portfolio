# Task
Create a recursive function that multiplies an `int a` with a `double b`. (Think of it as multiple additions).
Then create another improved recursive multiplication function (this improved version was given to us in the task,
look at the implementation to see what it was) and measure the two time complexities using masters method.

## Time complexity
The initial multiply function runs in Θ(n) time. The improved version runs in Θ(log(n)) time.
